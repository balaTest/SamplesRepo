            Use more specific rules. By indicating one or more elements before the element you're selecting the rule is more specific and gets higher priority:
        </p>
        <p>
            No matter what the order in the css file, the text will be green because that rule is most specific. (Also, the rule for blue overwrites the rule for red, no matter the order of the rules)
